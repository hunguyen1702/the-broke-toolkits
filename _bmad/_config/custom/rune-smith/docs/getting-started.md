# Getting Started with RMTN Developer Suite

Welcome to rune-smith! This guide will help you get up and running.

---

## What This Module Does

**RMTN Developer Suite** is a "Senior Developer in a Box" that automates context-keeping and planning overhead, allowing a solo developer to move with the speed and quality of a full team.

It enforces a "Plan → Execute" discipline with automated context management via two specialized agents:
- **Mimir (The Sage):** Handles context and documentation (Saga).
- **Thor (The Builder):** Handles planning and execution (Quests).

---

## Installation

If you haven't installed the module yet:

```bash
bmad install rune-smith
```

Follow the prompts to configure the module for your needs. You will be asked where to store your Saga (context) and Quests.

---

## First Steps

1.  **Genesis (Onboarding):**
    - Trigger Mimir with `[FP] Forge PRD` to generate the PRD document.
    - Then run `[FA] Forge Architecture` to generate the Architecture document.
    - Mimir will analyze your codebase and generate the **Saga** (`prd.md` and `architecture.md`).
    - Review and approve these documents. They are now the "Source of Truth".

2.  **The Quest (Feature Work):**
    - Trigger Thor with `[NQ] New Quest`.
    - Describe the feature you want to build.
    - Thor will read the Saga, propose 3 approaches, and score them.
    - Once you select an approach, Thor drafts a **Tech Spec** (Quest file).

3.  **Execution:**
    - Trigger Thor with `[EX] Execute Quest`.
    - Point him to the created Quest file.
    - Thor implements the changes step-by-step.

## Common Use Cases

- **Daily Feature Work:** Using the Quest system to build complex features with high quality.
- **Bug Fixing:** Using `[QF] Quick Fix` for rapid patches without overhead.
- **Project Onboarding:** Using `[FP] Forge PRD` and `[FA] Forge Architecture` to quickly generate documentation for a new or existing codebase.
